# Watson Workspace for Franz
This is a plugin for [Franz 5](https://github.com/meetfranz/franz) to work with IBM Watson Workspace.

[Update]: This plugin is no longer supported or maintained, and the repo is being archived (read-only), due to [IBM's announcement of its "end of marketing"](https://help.workspace.ibm.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015622373).

## Adding To Franz

Until Watson Workspace is added to the Franz plugins repository, to get this working, you can:

- cd into your Franz recipes `/dev/` directory, you may need to create it
  - Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Franz/recipes/dev/`
  - Windows: `%appdata%/Franz/recipes/dev/`
  - Linux: `~/.config/Franz/recipes/dev`
- `git clone https://github.com/edm00se/franz-recipe-watson-workspace.git`
- restart Franz

IBM "Watson Workspace" should now be an option available from services under "development" when you select to add a new service.
